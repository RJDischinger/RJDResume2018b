# RJDResume2018b
Resume Project
This is my resume file for the codeLouisville Front-End-Web-Development course.
The class was for the May 2018 session.
This project was started using Code Pen, but was mostly written and completed using Visual Studio Code.
I wrote the programs using Windows based equipment, but the project has been tested on Apple iPad devices as well.

Company logo images are saved in the img file.
Other images are retrieved online and were labeled with reuse permission.
I set-up a server based file on cloudinary.com to retrieve some images that I personally own.
